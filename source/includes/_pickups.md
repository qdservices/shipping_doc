# Pickups

The Pickup resource is used to create, list, update and delete Pickups.

With the Pickup API, you can decide to ask the courier to pickup your shipments or drop off by yourself to the courier nearby.

Before you start to request a pickup, you have the option to retrieve available pickup options and then use the Request Pickup resource to ask the courier to collect your shipments in your preferred time slot.
