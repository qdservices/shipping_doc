# Introduction

Welcome to the OmniShip Cross Border API Documentation! 

The OmniShip Cross Border API allows you to perform cross border operations on the OmniShip system.

OmniShip Cross Border API is built using REST principles which ensures predictable URLs that makes writing applications easy. 
This API follows HTTP rules, enabling a wide range of HTTP clients which can be used to interact with the API.

Every resource is exposed as a URL. The URL of each resource can be obtained by accessing the API Root Endpoint [https://crossborder.omniship.eu/api/v1/](https://crossborder.omniship.eu/v1/).

For example the Customers resource is reachable at [https://crossborder.omniship.eu/api/v1/customers](https://crossborder.omniship.eu/v1/customers).
