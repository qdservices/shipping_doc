# Introduction

Welcome to the ShipSmart API Documentation! 

The ShipSmart API allows you to perform operations on the ShipSmart system.

ShipSmart Shipping API is built using REST principles which ensures predictable URLs that makes writing applications easy. 
This API follows HTTP rules, enabling a wide range of HTTP clients which can be used to interact with the API.

Every resource is exposed as a URL. The URL of each resource can be obtained by accessing the API Root Endpoint [https://app.shipsmart.eu/api/{platform}/v1/](https://app.shipsmart.eu/api/{platform}/v1/).

For example the Shipments resource is reachable at [https://app.shipsmart.eu/api/shipping/v1/shipments](https://app.shipsmart.eu/api/shipping/v1/shipments).
